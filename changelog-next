- Added support for [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories) mod.
- Breaking a grave as it's owner, it will first try to quick-pickup it before dropping everything. It can be disabled in config.
- Made error/exception catching within grave creation more robust, allowing for displaying more information
and lower chance of losing entire inventory (for example when other mod changes it's api or implements it incorrectly).
- Fixed serialization of entity type's in config, fixing disabling graves when killed by selected entity.
